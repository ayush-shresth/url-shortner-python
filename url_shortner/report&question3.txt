Design and implementation of URL shortner

As rest was stated to be used. We choose the flask framework and the library called flask-restful services.
For the URL Shortening service, we used the base62 encode and decode.
The URL is stored in the temporary sqlite3 database along with an id and when it restarts the state of memory resets.
URL correctness is verified using the base62 decode function. All the methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE are implemented for both '/' and '/:id' endpoints.


Answer for question 3 :


A simple authentication mechanism can be used when the URL shortener service is used.
A unique hash can be given to the user which can he use along with URL input.
The best example for this is the linkshim mechanism used by Facebook.
